                    Your vehicle needs a clean source of air to provide combustion. Make sure to check your air filter regularly to prevent contamination.
                    after removing the air filter from the vehicle hold it up to a lightsource. If you cannot visibly see any light coming through the airfilter it is time to replace it with a new one.
